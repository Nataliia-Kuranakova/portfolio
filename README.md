# Portfolio

## Introduction

Inspired by the visual simplicity of printed materials, I set out to create a minimalist and easy-to-use website that could represent my skills and determination. This project serves as a platform to showcase my skills. Visitors can easily change the theme of the site, navigate through the pages, get information about me, find a list of completed projects and view detailed cases that I have studied within each project.
